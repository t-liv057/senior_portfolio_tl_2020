Portfolio of a few assignments from my undergrad

Up to date [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wz6c62Eno_ECbQw1TZeaMRc_ayqPNk8JdW4xEwT7lCQ/edit?usp=sharing).

First assignment [Software Engineering Final Project](https://github.com/GitGudDesu/Final-Release).

I'm not listed as a contributor on this repo, but I did a substantial amount of work coding game mechanics and other features in the game.  This is a game developed on the Unity engine and the backend is written mostly in c#.  I learned c# specifically for this assignment and found it a slightly nicer version of Java in a lot of ways.  This was a 4 person team that split up the work to cover a lot of ground.  The app ended up looking really good and playing fairly well.  We worked together to put together an app that I think most of the class was impressed by, and I'm still proud of the work I did.  Working on this for a whole semester gave me significant experience working alone and in a group on a project like this.


Second assignment [Artificial Intelligence Research](https://github.com/t-liv057/tl_data_simulation_cmpt_301).

This was a fun paper for me to write in artificial intelligence partly because it was a break from code, but also because it was a topic that interested me a lot.  I think the concept of creating quality data from smaller amounts of real data poses some cool possibilities, and learned that there's significant evidence to back it up as a strategy.  For me something like this is a great example of learning to solve problems with limited resources or information.  I think researching stuff like this benefited my problem solving skills tremendously.  I can see something like this helping out the world as we ramp up a dependence on AI.  Data is definitely gold so being able to synthesize it and still describe reality with enough precision is amazing.  I think technology like this gives me a bigger sense of global responsability considering the potential.

Third assignment [Computer Networks Chatroom](https://github.com/t-liv057/chat_room_cmpt_352).

This was a server-client chat room Diwas Poudel and I worked on together I believe sophomore year.  I don't think it ended up working perfectly but I was able to learn a lot about working closely with someone on a project like this.  Luckily Diwas is a really great programmer and was able to help out a lot, but it was one of the first times I felt comfortable relying on someone else's code for an assignment.  The material was also pretty cool because it was one of my first introductions to threading and multiprocessing.  Using Java during this time was really fun for learning.  We had the option to be really creative with this assignment so the collaboration in general was fun.  Working together to design a protocol was hard but eventually we worked something out.

Fourth assignment [Computer Architecture Digital Logic](https://github.com/t-liv057/digital_logic_cpmt_328).

This digital logic lab was one of the most fascinating labs I've completed at Westminster.  If I recall correctly it is simulating binary arithmetic in the ALU(arithmetic logic unit).  This assignment, and class in general, gave me a much better fundamental understanding of how computers operate on the hardware level.  I always had questions about how computers actually worked and this was my first time receiving satisfying answers.  I think I asked far more than my fair share of questions, but after a lot of rigid and critical thinking about what was going on I came out a lot more informed after.

Fifth assignment [Intro to Computer Science](https://github.com/t-liv057/turtles_lab_cmpt_201).

Thinking back this is the first time I contemplated the structure of software and why file systems are the way that they are.  I had never conceptualized what a program might look like in development, and this was one of my first times ever using Java.  There was a lot of shared misery in these classes because we all had so much learning to do, but ultimately there was a lot more teamwork in that class than many others.  I remember deciding that I was going to learn how to move the turtle about the screen to create the correct shape on the screen and not stopping for hours until I did.  Object oriented programming was so difficult for me to understand at first it's strange to think about now.  I think getting that turtle to create the correct start patter was one of the first times I was satisfied with a piece of code.
